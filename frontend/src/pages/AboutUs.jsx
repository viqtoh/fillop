          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At Fillop, our mission is to make quality education accessible, engaging, and flexible
            for all. We believe learning should extend beyond traditional classrooms and adapt to
            the needs of modern learners. Whether you're a student seeking flexibility or a lecturer
            looking to share knowledge more widely, Fillop is designed with you in mind. We empower
            lecturers to create and share rich multimedia contentâ€”videos, presentations, documents,
            and interactive assessmentsâ€”making it easy to deliver impactful lessons. For students,
            our platform offers the freedom to learn at their own pace, anytime, anywhere, with
            tools that support continuous growth. Fillop isnâ€™t just a platform; itâ€™s a step toward a
            more inclusive, tech-driven future of education where knowledge knows no boundaries.
          </p>
          <p className="aboutUsTextLg">
            More than just connecting educators and learners, Fillop fosters a thriving academic
            community built on innovation, support, and shared goals. Weâ€™re dedicated to creating a
            safe, reliable, and user-friendly environment where learning is not just a taskâ€”but an
            experience that inspires, uplifts, and transforms.
